            <h1>What <b>EXACTLY</b> is JavaScript?</h1>
        </header>
        <p><b>JavaScript</b> often abbreviated as <b>JS</b>, is a high-level, 
            interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
            It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, 
            prototype-based and multipul-paradigm.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
            JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. 
            The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript 
            engine to execute it. JavaScript supports object-oriented, 
            imperative, and functional programming styles. JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, 
            which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. 
            JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behaviour.</p>

            <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            <p>The if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.
                The if/else statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</p>
                
                <p>In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
                    
                Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
                Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
                Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
                Use switch to select one of many blocks of code to be executed</p>

        <div>    
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>Generally speaking, a function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external 
                (or internal in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a 
                function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. 
                Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.</p>

            <p>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have 
                properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes 
                them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, 
                they are Function objects.</p>

            <div> 
                <h2>Loops</h2>
                <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take 
                    X steps in one direction then Y steps in another.</p>

                <p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: 
                    they repeat an action some number of times (and it's actually possible that number could be zero). 
                    The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. 
                    There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.</p>

                </div>
                <div> 
                    <h2>Arrays</h2>
                    <p>Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list.
                         Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we
                          can access each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and 
                          do the same thing to every value. Maybe we've got a series of product items and their prices stored in an array, and we want to loop 
                          through them all and print them out on an invoice, while totaling all the prices 
                          together and printing out the total price at the bottom.</p>

                <div> 
                    <h2>Objects</h2>
                    <p>Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. 
                        The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.

                        In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. 
                        A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, 
                        JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

                        JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, 
                        and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, 
                        in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, 
                        you can define your own objects.
